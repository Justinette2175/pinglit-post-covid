## About

I built this project in the context of the 2020 post-COVID hackathon. Pinglit won the Education Stream competition, for which the ask was to create a solution to facilitate at-home evaluation of students.

Pinglit is a collaborative platform that enables conversations between readers around books and articles. It consists of boards of pins that can be ordered along a timeline, which represents the timeline of the book. Students place multimedia pins along the timeline to indicate their reactions and thoughts about individual passages in the book. They can complete assignments using pins as well as interact with classmates.

Pinglit is still under construction!
